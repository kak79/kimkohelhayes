    <header><div class="right">My first tech job was doing technical support for General Instruments (GI). GI developed analog and digital wired cable television into the form that cable companies such as Spectrum use today. While I was there I learned UNIX and SQL. I was also given my first introduction to programming languages in the form of watching our escalation team program in fixes and decided then and there that was what I wanted to do. Little did I know it would take me 20 years to do it.<br><br> 
    Over the years since, I have been exposed to a few different languages through college courses and both web and mobile apps. A few of them include HTML and CSS. I am also familiar with the Ubuntu operating system as I setup a dual boot system for a while to explore Python.<br><br> 
    Yes, I have done other jobs over the years. But nothing fit me like this does.</div></header>
